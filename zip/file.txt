"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
Section 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by Cicero in 45 BC

"At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus.

1914 translation by H. Rackham

"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."

n earlier versions of Access, we used the Memo data type to store large amounts of text, and the Text data type to store shorter strings (up to 255 characters). In Access 2013 and Access 2016, these two data types have been renamed “Long Text” and “Short Text” respectively, and they have different properties and size limits depending on whether you’re using a desktop database or an Access web app. Here are the details:
Text fields in desktop databases (.accdb)

Long Text    In .accdb files, the Long Text field works the same as the Memo field of old. That is, it can store up to about a gigabyte of text, even though controls on forms and reports can only display the first 64,000 characters. You can set Long Text fields to display Rich Text, which includes formatting like bold and underline.

Short Text    In .accdb files, the Short Text field works the same as the Text field in earlier versions. It stores up to 255 characters.

Learn more about data types for Access desktop databases.
Text fields in Access web apps

Long Text    In Access web apps, the Long Text field can store up to 2^30-1 bytes, and is equivalent to the SQL Server data type of nvarchar(max). If you want, you can set a character limit to prevent your users from using the full capacity of the field. You can’t store Rich Text in Access web apps.

Short Text    In Access web apps the Short Text field is set to store 255 characters by default, but you can adjust the Character Limit property all the way up to 4000 characters. Its SQL Server equivalent is nvarchar, with length from 1 to 4000.

Learn more about data types for Access web apps.
Default controls for Long Text and Short Text fields

In most cases, Access uses Text Box controls to display Short Text or Long Text fields. However, when you add a Long Text field to a view in an Access web app, Access creates a Multiline Textbox. When using a Multiline Textbox in the browser, you can press Enter to move to a new line in the textbox. If you’re in a datasheet, you’ll need to use the scrollbars to see anything below the first line.

In Desktop databases, if a Long Text field is configured to show Rich Text, and you add that field to a form or report, Access automatically applies the Rich Text setting to the text box.
